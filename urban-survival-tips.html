<h1>10 Urban Survival Tips</h1>
<p>When the city crumbles, comfort turns to chaos. Forget lattes and streaming — here's how to survive when urban convenience collapses into lawless gridlock.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Get Out Fast:</strong> Cities trap people like roaches. Have a bug-out plan. Early exit = best exit.</li>
<li><strong>Grey Man Wins:</strong> Dress low-key, don’t look rich. Stay unnoticed. Flashy equals dead.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Off Main Roads:</strong> Crowds attract attention and bullets. Learn back routes and alleys.</li>
<li><strong>Silent Kills the Noise:</strong> No shouting, no music, no light. Silence = survival.</li>
<li><strong>Know Your Landmarks:</strong> GPS might fail. Learn buildings, graffiti routes, and sewer access.</li>
<li><strong>Trade Smart:</strong> In a barter economy, skills and items > paper money. Razor blades beat Rolexes.</li>
<li><strong>Scavenge at Odd Hours:</strong> Move at dawn or 3 a.m. — avoid desperate mobs.</li>
<li><strong>Use Rooftops and Tunnels:</strong> Vertical movement avoids ground-level chaos. Think up/down.</li>
<li><strong>Control Your Group:</strong> Too big = slow. Too small = vulnerable. 3–5 disciplined people max.</li>
<li><strong>Watch for Traps:</strong> Desperate humans do desperate things. Be paranoid. You're probably right.</li>
</ol>
<p>Concrete jungles aren't made for survivors — but you’re not average, are you?</p>
