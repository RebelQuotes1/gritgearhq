<h1>10 Items for Car Survival</h1>
<p>If you get stranded in your car, you're in a steel coffin — unless you’ve packed smart. Here's what every vehicle should have before you end up in the ditch with no signal and freezing rain.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wool Blanket:</strong> Cheap. Reliable. Life-saving warmth when the heater's gone.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-tool:</strong> Cuts, twists, unscrews, stabs. All-in-one lifeline.</li>
<li><strong>First Aid Kit:</strong> Bleed control, pain relief, gauze. Don’t forget trauma shears.</li>
<li><strong>Water Pouches:</strong> Freeze-proof, compact. Enough to hold you 48 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Flashlight & Batteries:</strong> Ditch your phone light. Use something meant for real work.</li>
<li><strong>Protein Bars:</strong> Won’t spoil in the heat. Won’t freeze in the cold. Energy, fast.</li>
<li><strong>Folding Shovel:</strong> Snow, mud, or burying a mistake — just kidding. Maybe.</li>
<li><strong>Phone Charger + Power Bank:</strong> You’ll need juice when it matters. Charge up every few days.</li>
<li><strong>Reflective Triangle + Flares:</strong> Be seen before you're crushed on a highway shoulder.</li>
<li><strong>Duct Tape:</strong> Fix hoses, bandage wounds, even make snowshoes. It's a miracle roll.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t just survive the road — dominate it.</p>
