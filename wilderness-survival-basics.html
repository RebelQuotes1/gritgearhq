<h1>10 Wilderness Survival Tips</h1>
<p>The woods don’t care about your feelings. Out there, it’s you, the elements, and whatever’s hunting. Here's how to go primal and stay alive.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Build Shelter First:</strong> Before food, before fire — get out of the wind and rain.</li>
<li><strong>Fire = Life:</strong> Master 3 ways to light one. Wet wood? Figure it out. Or freeze.</li>
<li><strong>Signal the Sky:</strong> Bright tarp, mirror, smoke. Get seen if you want out.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t Drink Every Stream:</strong> Boil or filter. Beaver fever is real and brutal.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Put if Lost:</strong> Wandering equals dying. Make yourself visible. Think, don’t panic.</li>
<li><strong>Sharp = Survival:</strong> Your knife is your lifeline. Keep it ready, keep it clean.</li>
<li><strong>Move Smart:</strong> Conserve energy. Scout daylight routes. Don’t “just walk east.”</li>
<li><strong>Track Time & Temp:</strong> Know sunset. Know signs of hypothermia. Plan backwards.</li>
<li><strong>Food Can Wait:</strong> Water matters more. Hunger won’t kill you in 3 days. Thirst will.</li>
<li><strong>Respect Nature, But Dominate It:</strong> You’re not prey. Not if you prep right.</li>
</ol>
<p>You’re not lost. You’re just off the grid — on purpose.</p>
