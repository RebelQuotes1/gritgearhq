<h1>10 Power Outage Survival Tips</h1>
<p>When the grid goes dark, most people panic. You? You're prepared. Here's how to ride out a blackout without losing your mind — or your meat.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Light It Right:</strong> Solar lanterns, candles, headlamps. Don't rely on one source.</li>
<li><strong>Battery Bank Army:</strong> Charge everything in advance. Rotate use, keep one fully juiced.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t Open the Fridge:</strong> Every peek is a 10-degree drop. Think before you grab that soda.</li>
<li><strong>Boil Water, Not Nerves:</strong> Know how to purify water manually. Blackouts often mess with city systems.</li>
<li><strong>Solar Power Wins:</strong> Get panels or a solar generator. Silent and endlessly useful.</li>
<li><strong>Cash on Hand:</strong> ATMs won’t work. Digital payments are dead. Old-school green is king.</li>
<li><strong>Portable Radio = Intel:</strong> A crank radio gives you news, weather, warnings. No guesswork.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Doors and Windows:</strong> Darkness breeds crime. Fortify the homestead quietly.</li>
<li><strong>Cook Smart:</strong> Camp stoves, grills, even a tin can rocket stove. Eat hot or stay cold.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Morale Up:</strong> Boredom kills faster than hunger. Cards, books, stories — anything but fear.</li>
</ol>
<p>Power comes and goes. Grit? That’s permanent.</p>
