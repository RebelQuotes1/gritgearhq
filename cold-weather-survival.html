<h1>10 Cold Weather Survival Tips</h1>
<p>Cold doesn’t care how tough you are. If you’re not ready, you’re dead weight in the snow. Here’s how to outlast the frostbite and stay alive when the world turns white.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Layer Like a Savage:</strong> Base, insulation, and waterproof shell. Cotton kills, wool wins.</li>
<li><strong>Cover Extremities:</strong> Hands, feet, ears, and your face. Cold targets the weak points.</li>
<li><strong>Sleep Off the Ground:</strong> Cold ground = body heat leech. Use pads, pine boughs, anything.</li>
<li><strong>Eat Fat, Burn Heat:</strong> High-calorie foods fuel your inner furnace. Eat like it matters.</li>
<li><strong>Insulate Shelter Walls:</strong> Use leaves, snow, or anything dry. Trap warmth inside.</li>
<li><strong>Ventilation Saves Lives:</strong> No airflow = carbon monoxide death trap. Crack something open.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Fire Ready Always:</strong> Waterproof matches, ferro rod, fire starters — redundancy is survival.</li>
<li><strong>Dry Clothes = Life:</strong> Change wet socks immediately. Don’t argue.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Active, Not Sweaty:</strong> Movement generates warmth. Sweat = killer chill once you stop.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t Sleep Drunk:</strong> Alcohol lowers your core temp. No whiskey naps in the snow, hero.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cold is brutal but predictable. Outthink it and you might just make it to spring.</p>
